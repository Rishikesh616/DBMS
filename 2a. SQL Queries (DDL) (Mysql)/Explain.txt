### Problem Statement
**Design and Develop SQL DDL statements which demonstrate the use of SQL objects such as Table, View, Index, Sequence, Synonym, and different constraints.**

---

### Prerequisites
1. **Basic SQL Syntax**: Understanding of SQL keywords, structure, and syntax.
2. **Knowledge of SQL Data Types**: Familiarity with data types like `VARCHAR`, `INT`, `DATE`, etc.
3. **Understanding SQL Objects**: Familiarity with tables, views, indexes, sequences, synonyms, and constraints.
4. **SQL Environment Setup**: Access to an SQL database and tools to execute DDL commands.

---

### Objectives
1. **Learn DDL Commands**: To understand how to define and structure SQL objects in a database.
2. **Utilize SQL Constraints**: Demonstrate different constraints like primary keys, foreign keys, unique, not null, and check constraints.
3. **Understand SQL Objects**: Gain practical knowledge of views, indexes, sequences, and synonyms in SQL.

### Detailed Theory

#### 1. **DDL (Data Definition Language) in SQL**
   - DDL is a subset of SQL commands used to define, modify, and manage database objects like tables, indexes, views, sequences, and synonyms.
   - DDL commands include `CREATE`, `ALTER`, and `DROP`.

#### 2. **SQL Objects Overview**
   - **Table**: Basic storage structure in SQL, consisting of rows and columns to hold data.
   - **View**: A virtual table based on the result of a `SELECT` query; provides a way to simplify complex queries.
   - **Index**: A database object to improve the speed of data retrieval operations by maintaining a sorted order of selected columns.
   - **Sequence**: Generates unique numeric values, often used for primary key generation.
   - **Synonym**: An alias for a database object, providing a simplified or alternative name.

#### 3. **Creating SQL Objects with DDL Statements**

   - **Creating a Table**: Define tables with columns and their data types, and apply constraints as needed.
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE Employees (
         EmpID INT PRIMARY KEY,
         FirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
         LastName VARCHAR(50),
         DepartmentID INT,
         Salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
         CONSTRAINT fk_dept FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentID) REFERENCES Departments(DeptID)
     );
     ```
     - **Primary Key**: Ensures uniqueness for `EmpID`.
     - **Foreign Key**: Links `DepartmentID` in `Employees` to `DeptID` in `Departments`.

   - **Constraints**: Constraints enforce rules on data. Here are a few commonly used constraints:
     - **Primary Key**: Uniquely identifies each row in a table.
     - **Foreign Key**: Maintains referential integrity by linking tables.
     - **Unique**: Ensures all values in a column are distinct.
     - **Not Null**: Prevents null values in a column.
     - **Check**: Enforces specific conditions on data values.
     
   - **Creating a View**: A view is a saved query that simplifies data access for complex queries.
     ```sql
     CREATE VIEW EmployeeDetails AS
     SELECT EmpID, FirstName, LastName, DepartmentID
     FROM Employees
     WHERE Salary > 50000;
     ```

   - **Creating an Index**: Indexes improve data retrieval speed, especially in large tables.
     ```sql
     CREATE INDEX idx_salary ON Employees (Salary);
     ```

   - **Creating a Sequence**: Sequences are used to generate sequential numbers.
     ```sql
     CREATE SEQUENCE emp_sequence START WITH 1 INCREMENT BY 1;
     ```

   - **Creating a Synonym**: A synonym provides an alternative name for an object, useful in simplifying queries.
     ```sql
     CREATE SYNONYM EmpTable FOR Employees;
     ```

#### 4. **SQL Constraints Explained**
   - **Primary Key Constraint**: Uniquely identifies each record; often auto-incremented by a sequence.
   - **Foreign Key Constraint**: Ensures referential integrity by linking columns between tables.
   - **Unique Constraint**: Enforces uniqueness for a column's values.
   - **Check Constraint**: Limits values based on a condition (e.g., `Salary > 0`).
   - **Not Null Constraint**: Prevents null values, ensuring data presence.
